===========

todo:
-mailer (see Jon's code or tutorial)
-configure scheduler
-create dotcloud account (or EC2, dotcloud is kinda slow)


We should make life easier by using:
1. http://cloudmailin.com/
2. http://dev.iron.io/worker/start/first-worker/
3. https://github.com/iron-io/iron_worker_examples/blob/master/ruby/email_worker/email_worker.rb

We can/should integrate with FB and tell the user stuff about the person they just met (Rapportive?)
What can mTurk do for us here? Research them even more.
If we integrate with FB/Twitter we can also extract the context of the meeting, especially if one of the people checked in or twitted or posted something about the event online
